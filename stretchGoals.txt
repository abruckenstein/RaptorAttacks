Stretch Goals:

Priority:
    History Sidebar
    Reason section for past code reds
    Add sign-in, so only authenticated users can click code red button, stopgap until next goal
    Automatic code red detection via slack

Nice to haves:
    Scream audio on reset clicked
    Siren during code red
    Hot swappable themes (i.e. click a button to change to tech/coder theme, button to switch back to horror theme, etc)
